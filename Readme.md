uiApiAutomation project details

Packages Details : 
   1. com.ui.api.automation.common.enums ===>
           Used to maintain hardcoded values in this file (ie) empty string ("") or Numbers (1,2,3) etc and  WebElement attributes like value, name etc
   2.  com.ui.api.automation.configuration ===>
   			Browser configuration and Allure Reports configurations are maintained
   3. com.ui.api.automation.model ===>
            Converted all pages into corresponding POJO classes. Instead of transferring data from feature files, read data from yaml and convert input data as POJO objects. This POJO object (Java Object) will be used for providing inputs in page classes during execution.
   4. com.ui.api.automation.pages ===>
             Maintain all pages in this package
   5. com.ui.api.automation.rerun ===>
             Maintain all the files related to re-execute failed testcases automatically during runtime execution.
   6. com.ui.api.automation.runner ===>
             Able to run our project using JUnit and TestNG. So Both runner files are kept here.
   7. com.ui.api.automation.steps ===>
             Used to maintain all step defn files 
   8. com.ui.api.automation.yamlDetails ===>
             To maintain location of all yaml files.
   9. com.ui.automation.helpers ===>
             YamlHelper is used to read data from  yaml files. VisibilityHelper is used to maintain explicit wait code for WebElements. To perform common operations like click(), sendKeys() etc, we kept commonFunctions class separately (To avoid code duplication, maintain code looks simple)
     
allure.properties ===> To Maintain allure report under target directory

Features Directory ===>  Maintain all the feature files under Feature directory

Screenshot Directory ==> To maintain failure testcases screenshots during execution
             
YamlData Directory ==> Maintain all testdata as yaml files. All yaml files are maintained under
                       YamlData directory    
Configure Lombok :

    In this framework, we have used lombok to generate getter setter methods for reading yaml data.

    2. Double click on lambok.jar file
    3. Configure location of eclipse
    4. Lombok installation will be successful
    5. Update Maven project

    7. Lombok will be configured successfully

Configure Maven :

     1. download latest maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
     2. Unzip and copy to C: Drive
     3. Configure MVN_HOME in environment variables
     4. Configure %MVN_HOME%\bin in PATH variables
     5. type as mvn -version
     6. Able to view maven version successfully
                       
POM Configuration Details  Parallel Execution:
        
         JUnit :
            We can run feature files into Parallel execution, NOT scenarios. 
            configure threadCount attribute as N to take N feature files at a time
         TestNG :
            We can run scenarios into Parallel execution
            configure threadCount attribute as N to take N feature files at a time   
            
POM Configuration Details for Rerun:

          JUnit :
            configure rerunFailingTestsCount attribute to reexecute failure testcases
            N times
         TestNG :
            We configured listeners in testng.xml file to reexecute failed testcases.

             
Execution Reports : 
      
       We are generating Allure Report. We have used allure-cucumber7-jvm dependencty to generate
       reports. Mentioned allure report listeners under plugin attribute in JUnit and TestNG Runner    
       files.
